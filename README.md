A beautiful, interactive Chinese character learning application that helps you master Chinese characters through daily practice, visual radical breakdowns, and spaced repetition.

## üéØ Purpose & Goals

**Tor Chinese** is designed to make learning Chinese characters systematic, visual, and engaging. The application focuses on:

- **Daily Character Study**: Learn one character thoroughly each day with comprehensive explanations
- **Visual Learning**: Color-coded radical breakdowns help you understand character composition
- **Contextual Understanding**: Real example sentences show characters in practical usage
- **Progress Tracking**: Review system with spaced repetition for long-term retention
- **Systematic Progression**: Structured learning path from HSK 1-3 characters

## üîß How It Works

### Character Loading System

Tor Chinese uses a sophisticated character loading system that supports multiple data sources:

1. **Weekly Files** (Recommended): `character_info/YYYY-MM/characters-week-N.json`
2. **Monthly Files**: `character_info/characters-YYYY-MM.json`
3. **Hardcoded Database**: Fallback character sets in the codebase

### Daily Character Mapping

Characters are mapped to calendar days using the formula:
```
characterIndex = (dayOfMonth - 1) % totalCharacters
```

This ensures consistent character selection while allowing for cycling through the character set.

### Learning Methodology

1. **Visual First**: Large character display with optional radical breakdown
2. **Contextual Learning**: Multiple example sentences showing real usage
3. **Component Understanding**: Detailed radical explanations with etymology
4. **Memory Reinforcement**: Mnemonics and visual memory aids
5. **Spaced Review**: Systematic review of previously learned characters
